        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Multiplayer Sudoku allows you to collaboratively work on the same Sudoku board with your friends through the internet. This twist brings the classic puzzle to a new level by enabling real-time cooperation.</p>
        <h3>Starting a Game</h3>
        <p>To create a game, simply enter a code that you want your game to be identified by and click Join. A new game will automatically be created. Share the code with your friends to invite your friends.</p>
        <h3>Joining a Game</h3>
        <p>To join a game, enter the code that your friend has shared with you and click Join. You will be redirected to the game board where you can start playing. Once joined, you can verify that your friend is in the same game by checking the player list on the right.</p>
        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>The game is played like a normal Sudoku game. The goal is to fill in the board such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9. The game is won when the board is completely filled in.</p>
        <p>You can enter 'pencil mode' to mark potential numbers for a grid square by clicking on the quill icon in the top right corner. To enter a number, click on a grid square and type the number on your keyboard. To clear a number, type the number again. To go back to pen mode, click the pencil.</p>
